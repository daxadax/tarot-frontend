The Rider-Waite tarot deck (also known as the Waite-Colman Smith deck) is one of the most popular tarot decks in use today.  The cards were drawn by illustrator Pamela Colman Smith from the instructions of academic and mystic A. E. Waite, and published by the Rider Company in 1910.  The symbols used were influenced by the 19th century magician and occultist Eliphas Levi.
